# Assignment 2
This is a simple interactive front-end web application.<br />

# Design Process
For this website, the design seems simple yet it is effective in achieving its goal.<br />
Allowing users to actively engage with the map data, <br/>
alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals<br />

# Features
Feature 1 - Personal Information<br />
It allows targeted user to read it through at first glance, to know more about me.<br /><br />
Feature 2 - My Projects<br />
It allows targeted user to identify the potential skills that they would be interested in.<br /><br />
Feature 3 - Contact form<br />
It allows targeted user to have a platform where they can reach out to me, either to give feedback or contact me.

# Technologies Used 
- Header<br />
This is to indicate the title of the website. In this case, I have included my full name as a headstart.<br /><br />
- Boostrap<br />
This is to arrange contents of the website. In a way, it makes the design of the website neater.<br /><br />
- Google Map API<br />
This is a form for any additional feedbacks. It helps people to reach out to me if they need so. 

# Testing

Go to the "Contact" page<br />
